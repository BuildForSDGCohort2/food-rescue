# Food Rescue

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a copy of https://github.com/BuildForSDGCohort2/food-rescue for SDGs. Just for ease of deployment to heroku, pending approval from BuildForSDG
=======
This is a software I am building for SDGs to solve the problem of food scarcity and hunger in the world. I believe that hunger is an artificial problem caused by poor distribution of food. This is because so much food is wasted by many families and some food also get wasted in farms because farmers are unable to get them to the market on time. This software is a solution that will help people to get food that they do not need across to those who need them. Our goal is to make sure that most of the food that get wasted in the world will instead be made available to those who are in need of them. This software will also combat increase in food prices that is caused by artificial scarcity of food.

More details soon ...
